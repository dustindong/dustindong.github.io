	Originally from Hawaii, I moved here in 2005 to start a new path in life. I wanted to get into a career of programming and was learning ruby on rails until I spoke to my brother (Java Programmer) and he suggested learning about UX design. He always knew I was more of a visual person. I am interested in UX design because design is something that's part of my everyday life. It's the reason why I choose to visit one website over the other. During my free time, I am a photographer and a poker player. My style of photography is urban landscapes, but do shoot events and weddings for commercial work. I love to play poker, and try to spend a couple of weekends a month at the casino. I am very excited for this course, and can't wait to meet the instructors as well as my fellow classmates.</p>
